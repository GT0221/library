# Library #

This library project is part of [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) javascript curriculum.

After learning about classes, I've decided to practice what I've learned and recreate a library 
web page using a class. I've learned many things in this project, but the most importing lesson 
is there are many ways to complete the same task with programming.

Currently you're able to add books that you've already read or are planning on reading.
This project uses local storage, so cleaning your browser data will delete your library.

Next Step
Re-visit this project after learning of other methods to store data besides local storage.
